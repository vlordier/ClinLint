  Complex metabolic network analysis revealed:
  - Parallel metabolic pathways: CYP3A4/2D6/2C19 with competitive substrate binding
  - Time-dependent inhibition (KI=0.2μM, kinact=0.04min-1) of CYP3A4
  - Transporter-enzyme interplay: OATP1B1/BCRP/P-gp modulation
  - Metabolic switching under enzyme saturation (Km shift 0.5→2.1μM)
  - Adaptive resistance through UGT1A1/SULT1A1 upregulation
  PBPK modeling predicted:
  - Non-linear pharmacokinetics above 200mg (AUC ratio 2.8)
  - Complex DDI risk with statins (OATP1B1/CYP3A4 interplay)
  - Food effect on bioavailability (high-fat meal: -45%)

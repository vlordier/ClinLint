# Regression Analysis Terminology

## Model Components
coefficient estimates
standard errors
confidence limits
prediction bounds
tolerance intervals
variance components
random effects
fixed effects
interaction terms
main effects

## Diagnostic Measures
residual analysis
leverage points
influential observations
outlier detection
collinearity assessment
heteroscedasticity check
normality testing
autocorrelation test
specification error
model adequacy

## Variable Selection Methods

variable importance
predictor screening
feature selection
model reduction

## Model Assessment

# Response Evaluation

## Primary Response Categories
# RECIST-aligned terminology
complete response (CR)
partial response (PR)
stable disease (SD)
progressive disease (PD)
not evaluable (NE)

## Response Measurements
# Quantitative parameters
response duration measurement
response depth quantification
response quality assessment
response pattern analysis
response kinetics evaluation
response dynamics monitoring
response magnitude calculation
response sustainability assessment

## Temporal Patterns
# Time-based parameters
time to response
duration of response
time to progression
progression-free interval
response maintenance period
treatment-free interval
disease-free period
survival duration

## Response Monitoring
# Assessment methods
imaging-based assessment
biomarker-based evaluation
clinical assessment
functional evaluation
quality of life assessment
symptom-based monitoring
performance status evaluation
patient-reported outcomes

  Longitudinal immune profiling revealed complex escape mechanisms:
  Baseline: PD-L1 TPS 80%, CD8+ TILs 45%, Th1/Th2 ratio 2.8
  Week 12: PD-L1 downregulation (TPS 15%), emergence of LAG-3+/TIM-3+ exhausted CD8+ (68%),
  MDSC expansion (CD11b+CD33+CD14-HLA-DRlow: 28% vs 5% baseline)
  Week 24: B7-H3/B7-H4 upregulation, loss of MHC-I expression (β2M mutation, VAF 15%),
  shift to TGF-β-high/IL-12-low microenvironment with M2 macrophage polarization (CD163+CD206+: 65%)
  Week 36: Complex immune evasion with loss of cancer-testis antigens (MAGE-A3/NY-ESO-1),
  gain of CD73/A2AR adenosine axis activation, and emergence of PD-L1- IFN-γ-resistant clones

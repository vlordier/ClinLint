  Longitudinal ctDNA analysis revealed emergence of multiple resistance mechanisms:
  Week 24: EGFR T790M (VAF 0.8%) + MET amplification (CN 4.2)
  Week 36: Loss of T790M, emergence of C797S (VAF 1.2%) + PIK3CA E545K (VAF 0.6%)
  Week 48: Complex resistance pattern with EGFR amplification (CN 8.6), multiple PIK3CA clones (E545K, H1047R VAFs: 2.8%, 1.1%),
  and MET exon 14 skipping variant (VAF 0.9%). Tumor heterogeneity index (Shannon diversity) increased from 0.31 to 0.85.

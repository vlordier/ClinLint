  Patient developed Grade 4 cytokine release syndrome with concurrent Grade 3 immune-mediated colitis and Grade 2 pneumonitis.
  Peak cytokine levels: IL-6 1200pg/mL (ULN 5), TNF-α 800pg/mL (ULN 20), IL-1β 150pg/mL (ULN 15).
  Endoscopy revealed diffuse colonic ulceration (Mayo score 3) with elevated calprotectin (2800μg/g).
  CT showed ground-glass opacities (GGO) in bilateral lower lobes (total GGO score 18/24).
  Treatment required tocilizumab (8mg/kg q6h×3), high-dose steroids (methylprednisolone 2mg/kg/day), and infliximab (5mg/kg×1).

  Time-dependent inhibition of CYP3A4 (KI=0.8μM, kinact=0.03min-1) was accompanied by concurrent OATP1B1 inhibition (IC50=0.3μM).
  Metabolic profiling revealed formation of reactive intermediate M5 (t1/2=8min) through sequential oxidation via CYP2D6 and CYP3A4.
  PBPK modeling predicted complex DDI risk with statins (AUC ratio: 2.8-4.2) and mechanism-based CYP3A4 inhibition (net effect: 67% reduction in CL).
  Transporter-enzyme interplay resulted in nonlinear pharmacokinetics above 100mg (Km,app shift from 0.5 to 2.1μM).

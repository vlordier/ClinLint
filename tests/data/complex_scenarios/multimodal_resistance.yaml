  Integrated single-cell and spatial analysis revealed complex resistance mechanisms:
  scRNA-seq identified 12 distinct cell states with branched differentiation trajectory.
  Spatial transcriptomics showed organized niches (immune-excluded vs inflamed regions).
  Clonal evolution analysis revealed parallel resistance paths:
  - EMT program activation (ZEB1high/VIMhigh) in hypoxic regions
  - Stem-like state transition (SOX2/NANOG) in perivascular areas
  - Immune evasion (B2M loss, HLA downregulation) in T-cell rich zones
  Metabolic reprogramming evidenced by spatial metabolomics:
  - Glycolysis activation (GLUT1/HK2/LDHA) in hypoxic regions
  - Oxidative phosphorylation (PGC1Î±/TFAM) in perivascular areas
  - Glutamine addiction (GLS1/SLC1A5) in rapidly proliferating zones

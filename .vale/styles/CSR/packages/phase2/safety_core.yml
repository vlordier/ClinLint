  # Core Safety Elements
  - dose-limiting toxicity with grading
  - maximum tolerated dose with algorithm
  - dose modification with thresholds
  - cumulative toxicity with trends
  - drug interactions with priorities
  - organ function with parameters
  - immunogenicity with validation
  - biomarker safety with analysis

  # Special Monitoring
  - cardiovascular with ECG
  - hepatic with liver tests
  - renal with clearance
  - bone marrow with counts
  - immune response with antibodies
  - metabolic with glucose/lipids
  - endocrine with hormones
  - neurological with exams

  # Primary Efficacy Elements
  - dose-response characterization with modeling
  - exposure-response correlation with analysis
  - biomarker response with validation
  - clinical endpoint with definition
  - effect size estimation with precision
  - therapeutic window with margins
  - optimal dose selection with criteria
  - treatment duration with rationale
  - interim analysis with decision rules
  - futility assessment with criteria

  # Secondary Assessments
  - pharmacodynamic markers with validation
  - quality of life measures with tools
  - functional assessments with scales
  - symptom reduction with scoring
  - disease modification with markers
  - resistance development with monitoring
  - durability of response with follow-up

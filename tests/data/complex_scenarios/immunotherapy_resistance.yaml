  Patient exhibited Grade 3 immune-mediated hepatitis (ALT 8.2×ULN, AST 6.8×ULN) with concurrent Grade 2 pneumonitis at Week 12. 
  Following temporary discontinuation and steroid therapy (methylprednisolone 2mg/kg/day), partial improvement was noted (ALT 2.4×ULN).
  Upon steroid taper at Week 16, hepatitis recurred (ALT 12.3×ULN) with new-onset Grade 2 thyroiditis (TSH <0.01 mU/L, free T4 38 pmol/L).
  Molecular analysis revealed PD-L1 adaptive resistance (TPS increase from 22% to 85%) and emergence of alternative immune checkpoints (LAG-3+TIM-3+ CD8+ T cells: 68%).

  # Primary Analysis Elements
  - confirmatory efficacy analysis with pre-specified hypothesis
  - non-inferiority margin with clinical justification
  - superiority margin with effect size rationale
  - multiplicity adjustment with FWER control
  - interim analysis with alpha spending
  - sample size re-estimation with criteria
  - missing data approach with sensitivity
  - estimand framework with ICE strategy
  - subgroup analysis with interaction testing
  - multicenter analysis with poolability

  # Secondary Analyses
  - hierarchical testing with ordered endpoints
  - sensitivity analysis with robustness check
  - covariate adjustment with specification
  - time-to-event analysis with censoring
  - repeated measures with mixed models
  - categorical analysis with odds ratios
  - continuous outcomes with MMRM
  - composite endpoints with components
  - mediator analysis with pathways
  - meta-analysis with synthesis

  # Clinical Relevance
  - effect size with MCID/MID
  - number needed to treat with CI
  - risk-benefit with quantification
  - quality of life with validation
  - patient preference with assessment
  - economic outcomes with analysis
  - treatment satisfaction with measures
  - adherence impact with factors
  - real-world applicability with context
  - therapeutic positioning with evidence
